Database Administration Dashboard 

Covered under AGPL 3.0, initially by Mark Nielsen. 
However, make donations under Public Domain. It easier to change to a new license or perhaps
make some critical libraries Lesser GPL for people who want to integrate drivers with their own stuff. 
Think about how Mongo does licensing. AGPL for its software, but other licenses for drivers. 
I don't know what will need to be AGPL or LGPL, so make donations in public domain. 
Only donations in public domain will be accepted here, if you wish to call it DAD. Feel free
to make up your own name with the software and do what you want (as long as you keep AGPL). 

Initially, everything will be written in Python. 
The goals are:
1. Inserting data into a database. 
2. Getting the data for monitoring services, like nagios, etc. 
3. Displaying the data. 
4. Creating a management interface so that you add/remove hosts, etc.
